Hi, I’m Sándor.

Two years ago, I began to textend my knowledge into the field of data analysis and data science, driven by a deep curiosity for data and how it can support better decision-making.

This portfolio highlights some of the hands-on projects I’ve completed using tools like SQL, Looker Studio, Pandas, Excel, and Jamovi.

Each project reflects my growing skill set and passion for turning complex data into clear, actionable insights.
